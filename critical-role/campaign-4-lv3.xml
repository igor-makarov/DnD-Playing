== Biography ==
As a fairy, Thimble is from [[Tír Cruthú]], also known as Faerie.{{ep ref|ep=4x1|2:26:10}} She was gifted to [[Thjazi Fang]] as a wedding present.{{ep ref|ep=4x2|1:01:56}} Thimble started aging when the doors to Faerie were closed.{{ep ref|ep=4x1|2:28:25}}

She fought alongside Thjazi as part of the [[Torn Banner]] for many years, and was known as Thjazi’s partner “in all things”.{{ep ref|ep=4x01|02:10:00}}

In the two weeks following Thjazi's arrest, Thimble, [[Thaisha Lloy]], [[Azune Nayar]], [[Casimir Gavendale]], [[Occtis Tachonis]], and [[Cyd Pridesire]] formulated a plan to rescue him, involving Thimble creating a glyph of Misty Step and planting it on Thjazi. 

=== [[Campaign 4]] ===
The safehouse Thimble was staying in was attacked and robbed before she could deliver the glyph, and she took down three assailants before falling unconscious. She was found by [[Teor Pridesire]], Azune, and Occtis following Thjazi’s execution. They informed her of Thjazi’s death and together they tried to put together why she was attacked. [[Kattigan Vale]] joined them and determined the attackers had likely been [[Crow Keepers]].{{ep ref|ep=4x01}} She, along with the others, went to [[Hal]]'s house to Thjazi's wake, where she wept over his body and asked [[Vaelus]] if she'd been the attacker. Vaelus told her she had not been. She and the other Torn Banner members, as well as Occtis, looked at the glyph that had been on Thjazi when he died and found that it had been a clever fake, and they discussed that the two missing members from the plan were Casimir and Cyd. Thimble decided to pursue the lead on Casimir in the morning, and stayed at Hal's, sleeping on Thjazi's chest. The following morning, Kattigan returned, and he and Occtis joined her in going to the [[Guard Tower]] to find Casimir. Before leaving, Thimble gave Hal a letter to give to [[Bolaire]], and Hal told her she could always stay at his home if she needed a place. At the Guard Tower, when she asked about Casimir, she, Kattigan, and Occtis were immediately attacked.{{ep ref|ep=4x02}} The fight went poorly until Vaelus, who had followed them, arrived and joined, killing two Crow Keepers. The rest fled except one they asked to stay and interrogate, who told them Casimir had been deeply in debt and had just paid it off in full the previous day, and had had a deed to a fortress in [[Gormalay]] as well, but that had been taken by Cyd. The group returned to Hal's, realizing Casimir had sold them out. There they encountered [[Julien]], who was looking for Occtis, but grabbed Thimble by the wings briefly in telling them this. Occtis and Vaelus left with him, and Kattigan and Thimble told Hal, Thaisha, Azune, and Murray what had happened when they returned. They also told Teor when he returned, bringing [[Wick]] and [[Tyranny]]. Thimble and Kattigan realized the Crow Keepers would likely give them trouble, and Teor, Wick, and Tyranny had to flee [[House Halovar]], so they all decided to leave the city and pursue Casimir and Cyd.{{ep ref|ep=4x03}}

MULTIPLE TABLES! NO ONE TRUSTS MATT MERCER! Brennan Lee Mulligan|vod=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUHrc_fXzZo&amp;t=1s|11:54}}

== Biography ==
=== Before Campaign 4 ===
Azune was left by his father when he was a teenager. At 15 years old, he fought as a rebel in the [[Falconer's Rebellion]] as part of the [[Torn Banner]] under the command of [[Loza Blade]] alongside [[Thjazi Fang]], [[Thimble]], [[Kattigan Vale]], [[Teor Pridesire]], and [[Casimir Gavendale]].{{ep ref|ep=4x02|1:58}} At some point, Azune joined the [[Revolutionary Guard]] in [[Dol-Makjar]] and became an Arcane Marshal.

In the two weeks following Thjazi's arrest, Azune, Thimble, Casimir, [[Thaisha Lloy]], [[Occtis Tachonis]], and [[Cyd Pridesire]] formulated a plan to rescue him, involving Thimble creating a glyph of ''Misty Step'' and planting it on Thjazi. Azune would be part of the proceedings to scan Thjazi for errant magic and falsely claim to find nothing.{{ep ref|ep=4x01|2h36m16s}}

=== [[Campaign 4]] ===
Azune checked Thjazi for magic as he was led to the gallows. Over ''Message'', Azune informed Thjazi that someone placed a glyph on him earlier, then relayed a message from Thjazi's brother [[Halandil Fang]]: Thjazi was always a hero in Hal's eyes. Assuring Thjazi that the work he started in the city continues, Azune cast ''Detect Magic'' to find what he believed was the glyph. He cleared Thjazi to be taken forward and indicated to him the glyph's location. However, Thjazi was still hanged and killed.{{ep ref|ep=4x01}}

Afterward, Azune brought Thjazi's body to Hal's home for the [[Farramh]], and he smoothed out Thjazi's features to hide his fear in his last moments. He watched Hal closely throughout the event to help him host the many guests. After an initial wariness, he and Teor reunited warmly, and Azune assured him that many in Dol-Makjar felt Thjazi's execution was an injustice. Growing concerned that Teor also had not seen Cyd, his brother, he, Occtis, and Teor went to Thjazi's safe house, where Thimble created the glyph. They found the place ransacked, Thimble severely injured, and the glyph still in her possession. Azune realized that something else was planted on Thjazi, and the group found that the [[Stone of Nightsong]] was stolen from the safe house, apparently by the [[Crow Keepers]].{{ep ref|ep=4x01}}

The group returned to Hal's house, where Azune discovered the item he detected on Thjazi was made to appear genuine using ''Magic Aura''. The following day, at work, Azune encountered [[Harondus Einfasen]] and learned that the [[Sundered Houses]] were taking over management of the [[Revolutionary Guard]], though not the Arcane Marshals such as himself. He then headed to Caravan Hill,{{ep ref|ep=4x02}} where [[Murray]] found him, and the two discussed the power grabs the Sundered Houses were taking in their respective workplaces. From there they went back to Hal's, having learned about a fracas at the [[Guard Tower]], and Azune was updated on Casimir's betrayal by Thimble. After Teor arrived with [[Wick]] and [[Tyranny]], Azune realized that group as well as Thimble and Kattigan, having fought the [[Crow Keepers]], needed to leave the city quickly, and most were also interested in tracking down Casimir. He helped them get horses and escape, and remained behind, reciting the names of the Falcon's Rest.{{ep ref|ep=4x03}}

== Biography ==
=== Before Campaign 4 ===
Kattigan was a member of the [[Torn Banner]] and served during the [[Falconer's Rebellion]].{{ep ref|ep=4x02|1:32}} A few days prior to Thjazi's execution, he was in [[Timmony]] on unspecified business.{{ep ref|ep=4x03|4:25:17}}

=== [[Campaign 4]] ===
Kattigan followed [[Teor]], [[Azune]], and [[Occtis]] to [[Thjazi]]'s hideout where they found [[Thimble]], and came in after they did, having been drinking since the execution. He was able to determine Thimble had likely been attacked by [[Crow Keepers]].{{ep ref|ep=4x01}} He joined them in going to the wake, and spoke with [[Loza Blade]] while he was there before leaving to continue to drink and eventually fall asleep in the woods. The following morning, he woke up and had [[Wulferic]] track Thimble, which led him back to [[Hal]]'s house. There, he paid his respects to Thjazi and, upon learning about the plan to save Thjazi that had failed, joined Thimble and Occtis in tracking down [[Casimir Gavendale]], a Crow Keeper and one of the two people from the plan who had not yet shown. When they arrived at the [[Guard Tower]] tavern, and Thimble asked about Casimir, they were immediately attacked.{{ep ref|ep=4x02}} The fight initially went poorly for them until [[Vaelus]] entered and killed two of the Crow Keepers, and after most of them fled, Thimble, Occtis, Kattigan, and Vaelus learned that Casimir had been the traitor and sold them out, then fled to [[Gormalay]], in Timmony, pursued by [[Cyd Pridesire]]. They returned to Hal's to provide him with an updated, and Occtis and Vaelus left with [[Julien]]. After [[Teor]], [[Tyranny]], and [[Wick]] arrived at Hal's, needing to leave town, they, along with Thimble and Kattigan, decided to go follow Casimir and Cyd's trail. Kattigan warned the others that the wilderness would be dangerous.{{ep ref|ep=4x03}}

'''Thaisha Lloy''' (pronounced "TAI-shuh") is an [[orc]] [[druid]]. As a player character in [[Campaign 4]], she is played by [[Aabria Iyengar]].

== Description ==
[[File:Thaisha Lloy - Solelle.jpg|300px|thumb|left|{{caption|subject=Thaisha Lloy|artist=Solelle|artist2=Hannah Friederichs|source=https://x.com/CriticalRole/status/1967679655416398110}}]]
Thaisha is a 6'4" orc with desaturated green skin, and long curly dark hair which is beginning to gray. Her fingers are red and black at the tips, and her eyes are black with silver and red irises. She wears fine clothes in the Lloy family colors (red for blood, and gray for the soot and scale of smiths).{{ep ref|ep=4x01|0:37:46}}

=== Personality ===
&lt;!-- Insert character personality here. If there is not a lot of information to dedicate sections for them, consider deleting the header and merging the section upwards.--&gt;
{{clr|left}}
== Biography ==
Thaisha was born into the noble Lloy family. Around age 19, she began a romantic relationship with [[Halandil Fang]] and they had two children together - [[Alogar]] and [[Shadia Fang]].{{ep ref|ep=4x01|01:55:19}} Thaisha was inspired by Hal's art and her own family's history to become a druid of the [[Old Path]].

Prior to his arrest, [[Thjazi Fang]] sent Thaisha with [[Occtis Tachonis]] to retrieve a box from Venatus and bring it back to [[Bolaire]].{{ep ref|ep=4x02|00:21:30}}

In the two weeks following Thjazi's arrest, Thaisha, Azune, Thimble, [[Casimir]], Occtis, and [[Cyd Pridesire]] formulated a plan to rescue him, involving Thimble creating a glyph of Misty Step and planting it on Thjazi. Thaisha and Occtis would be responsible for escorting Thjazi out of the city to a safe place.{{ep ref|ep=4x01|00:42:17}}

=== [[Campaign 4]] ===
Thaisha arrived at Halandil's home for Thjazi’s funeral, alongside Occtis, one of the first guests to arrive. Thaisha introduced the Fangs to Occtis and confirmed that she will be staying for the time being. She grew jasmine flowers around the entrance to the home with druidic magic, and used those flowers to welcome guests. At the wake, she mingled with other guests and recited funerary rites for Thjazi. She bonded with [[Tyranny]] while intoxicated, but sobered up to greet [[Elodie]] and [[Aranessa]]. She and [[Julien]] then exchanged heated words about his disrespect for Thjazi and about his tutelage of Thaisha's son [[Alogar]], but were interrupted by [[Vaelus]]'s arrival. Thaisha then went upstairs with Hal and opened the box she and Occtis had retrieved.{{ep ref|ep=4x01}} She immediately fell unconscious, hearing the song of a nightingale, and Hal healed her. She realized that Shadia was angry at her for this. After [[Bolaire]] and [[Murray]] took the box away, Thaisha returned downstairs, and remained at the wake for the rest of the night, continuing to talk to guests. She slept in her room at the house, as did Occtis, and woke up to make breakfast with Hal and talk more with [[Thimble]].{{ep ref|ep=4x02}}

Later that day, she joined Hal in going to the [[Hallowed Round]] and had a heartfelt conversation with Shadia. Upon returning to Hal's, she learned that Julien had come to retrieve Occtis, and Wildshaped into a wolf to follow Occtis's scent. As she approached, still in this form, she and Vaelus saw each other at a distance and realized that despite being on opposite sides philosophically regarding the [[Shapers]], they would have to find commonality. Thaisha continued to run towards the [[Palazzo Davinos]].{{ep ref|ep=4x03}}

'''Bolaire Lathalia''' is a warlock and curator of the Lloy Wing at the [[Archanade]] museum. As a player character in [[Campaign 4]], he is played by [[Taliesin Jaffe]].

== Description ==
[[File:Bolaire Lathalia - Solelle.jpg|300px|thumb|left|{{caption|subject=Bolaire Lathalia|artist=Solelle|artist2=Hannah Friederichs|source=https://x.com/CriticalRole/status/1967679660105535936}}]]

Bolaire is a gray clay mask with black lips and two dark pools where the eyes should be; behind those are reflected tiny blue lights. The mask can move, though not much.{{ep ref|vod=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94mCyd_2Q_Y|ep=Critical Role Cast Interview with Brennan Lee Mulligan Campaign 4|10:15}} 

His body is a host that the mask possesses and is clothed from head to toe, with only a long, curly red wig being visible. Bolaire typically wears a cloak to keep a low profile.

=== Personality ===
Taliesin describes Bolaire as socially between [[Percy]] and [[Molly]],{{ep ref|vod=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94mCyd_2Q_Y|ep=Critical Role Cast Interview with Brennan Lee Mulligan Campaign 4|9:57}} and as a "truthful" person.{{ep ref|ep=CRITICAL ROLE CAMPAIGN 4 INTERVIEW!

== Biography ==
=== Before Campaign 4 ===
Bolaire claims to be one of the [[panto mask]]s, a set of sentient magical masks created by [[halfling]]s during the [[Shapers' War]] to perform a play that would kill their goddess [[Rauwyn]]. Bolaire would become dormant whenever not worn, and would be donned again many times in the next decades during wars that followed. During the [[Falconer's Rebellion]], Bolaire became dissatisfied with being used as a tool and absconded (abducting his current holder), becoming the curator of the [[Archanade]], a museum of magical artifacts.{{ep ref|ep=The Cast of Critical Role Discusses Campaign 4|vod=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9Mtkh1FUPA|7:22}}{{ep ref|ep=4x04|04:05:05|name=Bolaire Backstory}}

Bolaire became re-enamoured with theater after watching a play put on by [[Halandil Fang]], and befriended the bard and [[Fang family|his family]]. [[Thjazi Fang]] somehow discovered the truth of Bolaire's nature, and blackmailed him into stealing artifacts from the Archanade's archive.{{ep ref|ep=4x04|03:52:44}}

Shortly before Thjazi Fang's execution, Bolaire let [[Vaelus]] into [[Dol-Makjar]].{{ep ref|ep=4x01|4:19:35}}

=== [[Campaign 4]] ===
In the moment before he died, Thjazi told his brother [[Halandil Fang]] that Bolaire had paint for him. [[Thimble]] additionally found that one of the only items left at her and Thjazi's hideout after she was attacked was a letter addressed to Bolaire. After Thjazi's execution, Bolaire arrived at Hal's home for the funeral. He made small talk with [[Tyranny]] and [[Murray]], and offered to help [[Thaisha]] with the guests. When Vaelus arrived, he pulled her aside and asked her what she was doing, and she pointed out that he had let her into the city.{{ep ref|ep=4x01}} Not long after, upstairs, Thaisha opened the box she and [[Occtis]] had retrieved for Thjazi from [[Venatus]] and fell unconscious as the area swirled with mist. Bolaire was among the guests who ran upstairs to see what had happened, and when he found out, chastised Thaisha for touching magical items without checking. He and Murray took the box, which they realized was a coffin for [[Olbalad]], back to the Archanade for study, and stayed up the remainder of the night, discovering that it seemed to be extremely deep. Murray left for work and Bolaire went back to his office for further study. He found a crate of paint for Hal on his way.{{ep ref|ep=4x02}} Later that day he brought the paint to Hal at the [[Hallowed Round]], having checked it and found it vaguely magical but with no clear spell effects.{{ep ref|ep=4x03}}

'''Vaelus''' is an [[elf]] [[paladin]] and follower of the dead goddess [[Sylandri]]. As a player character in [[Campaign 4]], she is played by [[Ashley Johnson]].

== Description ==
[[File:Vaelus - Solelle.jpg|300px|thumb|left|{{caption|subject=Vaelus|artist=Solelle|artist2=Hannah Friederichs|source=https://x.com/CriticalRole/status/1967679662462734550}}]]

Vaelus is a tall elf with lavender skin.{{Ep ref|ep=4x1|4:16:33}} She is eight centuries old.&lt;ref&gt;{{CR|critical-recap-critical-role-c4e01-the-fall-of-thjazi-fang/|Critical Recap: Critical Role C4E01 “The Fall of Thjazi Fang”}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wears a chainmail veil of mourning. She is heavily scarred and burned in a manner that looks arcane. She carries a censer with a very long chain.{{Ep ref|ep=4x1|4:07:38}}

=== Personality ===
Ashley describes Vaelus as a mysterious person,{{ep ref|ep=CRITICAL ROLE CAMPAIGN 4 INTERVIEW! MULTIPLE TABLES! NO ONE TRUSTS MATT MERCER! Brennan Lee Mulligan|vod=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUHrc_fXzZo&amp;t=1s|11:07}} and someone acquainted with the history of [[Aramán]].{{ep ref|ep=The Cast of Critical Role Discusses Campaign 4|vod=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9Mtkh1FUPA|2:42}}
{{clr|left}}
== Biography ==
Vaelus comes from the [[Mournvale]].{{Ep ref|ep=4x1|4:13:22}} She is a member of the [[Sisters of Sylandri]], worshippers of [[Sylandri]].{{Ep ref|ep=4x1|4:11:15}}
She witnessed the death of the last [[deities of Aramán|deity of Aramán]].{{Ep ref|ep=4x1|4:16:33}}

=== [[Campaign 4]] ===
Vaelus traveled for a few weeks from the Mournvale to [[Dol-Makjar]] to retrieve the [[Stone of Nightsong]] from [[Thjazi Fang]].{{Ep ref|ep=4x1|4:11:52}} [[Bolaire Lathalia]] let her into the city.{{Ep ref|ep=4x1|4:19:51}} When [[Thaisha]] touched the coffin of [[Olbalad]], she heard the song of a nightingale, and saw Vaelus as the mist cleared. [[Murray]] asked Vaelus to be kind to [[Hal]] and his family, and Vaelus promised to enact no unnecessary murder, which did not comfort [[Shadia]]. After [[Thimble]] and [[Occtis]] returned from Thjazi's hideout, Vaelus learned the stone had been stolen, and asked to speak with Thimble privately. Occtis sent [[Pincushion]] to observe the conversation, but both women noticed him. Vaelus told Thimble that she did not harm Thjazi nor was she behind his execution, and only wanted to retrieve the stone. They returned downstairs, where Hal offered Vaelus a tray of cranberry rolls but told her not to bother his family. She left and remained on the porch all night.{{ep ref|ep=4x02}}

The following day she followed Occtis, Thimble, and [[Kattigan]] to the [[Guard Tower]] where they intended to investigate Thimble's attackers, and when their combat with the [[Crow Keepers]] went poorly, she crashed through the window and killed two Crow Keepers, including [[Solomon]], at which the remainder fled. They kept one, [[Gavrey]], behind for questioning, and he told them [[Casimir Gavendale]] had paid off a large number of debts the previous day and had additionally had a deed of title to a location in [[Gormalay]], and the group realized he likely sold what had been in Thjazi's safe house, including the stone. They returned to Hal's, where [[Julien]] was waiting for Occtis. Occtis decided to go with him, and Vaelus followed. They were taken to the [[Palazzo Davinos]], where Vaelus heard a wolf's call and realized the wolf had to be let in to the garden or something terrible would happen, and made the guards open the gate. As she waited for the wolf, who was a Wildshaped Thaisha, to arrive, Julien told her he believed something bad was about to happen. Immediately after, his father, [[Raimond Davinos]], was assassinated by a member of [[House Tachonis]].{{ep ref|ep=4x03}}

=== Personality ===
&lt;!-- Insert character personality here. If there is not a lot of information to dedicate sections for them, consider deleting the header and merging the section upwards.--&gt;
{{clr|left}}
== Biography ==
Julien is a member of [[House Davinos]], a vassal house to the [[Sundered House]] of [[House Royce]]. [[Aranessa Royce]] is an old childhood friend of his.{{ep ref|ep=4x1|3:16:45}}

He is considered the "hero of the Battle of Maharlian Falls" in the [[Falconer's Rebellion]] for knocking [[Thjazi Fang]] off his horse and bringing him to justice.{{ep ref|ep=4x1|3:20:22}}

=== [[Campaign 4]] ===
After the execution of Thjazi Fang, Sir Julian accompanied Lady Aranessa to Thjazi's wake in [[Halandil Fang]]'s home. When he approached the threshold, [[Thaisha]] let the plants she had ''Druidcrafted'' wither around him. She then met him outside and the two had a heated discussion about his attitude and his tutelage of Thaisha's son [[Alogar]], but were interrupted by the arrival of [[Vaelus]].{{ep ref|ep=4x01}} He and Aranessa left sometime later, and she told him [[Raimond Davinos|his father]] was waiting to see him the next day, at which he looked angry. He instead went to a brothel, and was woken up by his father tracking him down and yelling his name the following morning. He dressed and left with his father, who berated him for his behavior, indicating this was a pattern, as they rode to the [[Palazzo Davinos]]. There, Raimond and Aranessa spoke about their supply caravans having been stopped on the far side of the [[Dvalmar Pass]] and expressed concern about [[House Tachonis]]. They tasked Julien to find [[Occtis]], who the Tachonis family was searching for on suspected connection to a plan to free Thjazi, and Julien left to do so after his father threw water in his face to sober him up.{{ep ref|ep=4x02}} On his way, he encountered [[Teor Pridesire]] in the marketplace and realized he was likely being sent to be killed by the [[House Halovar]] fixers, but did not tell him this and continued on to Hal's to find Occtis. When [[Thimble]], [[Kattigan]], Occtis, and Vaelus returned to the house, Occtis in disguise, he grabbed Thimble by the wings and dismissed her value and let her go before telling the group that Occtis was in danger. Occtis believed him and decided to follow him, and Vaelus joined him. He brought them to the Palazzo Davinos, where his father and Aranessa received the guests. He then, instead of drinking with several friends, went to speak to Vaelus, who was in the garden, about how he felt uneasy about what was happening. Their conversation was interrupted when members of house Tachonis assassinated Raimond.{{ep ref|ep=4x03}}

== Biography ==
=== Prior to Campaign 4 ===
Tyranny was given corporeal form six months prior to [[Thjazi Fang]]'s execution, having previously been a soul in the [[Pit]]. She was assigned to [[Wicander Halovar]] as an Aspirant. Unlike him, she knew that the [[Candescent Creed]] was false, but she found that Wick seemed to be a better person than the others of his family and grew fond of him.{{ep ref|ep=4x03|42:20}}

=== [[Campaign 4]] ===
Tyranny and Wick watched the execution, and Tyranny's sister [[Enmity]] berated her for her "dimmings". They later arrived at Thjazi's farramh following his execution and were given a somewhat chilly reception, as [[House Halovar]] had had a hand in the execution. She drank an entire bottle of liquor and went to the kitchen with [[Olgud Akarat|Olgud]] to get more for Wick, until [[Thaisha]] found her and intervened. The two hit it off, and Thaisha got drunk and confided in Tyranny about her past. When [[Bolaire]] arrived, he made small talk with Tyranny, who had vomited in an artifact at the Archanade some months ago. After [[Aranessa]] arrived, and began asking Wick why she had not been given an audience with [[Yanessa Halovar|his grandmother]], Tyranny vomited again and used it as an excuse to leave and take Wick with her.{{ep ref|ep=4x01}} The following day, she went to answer the door for [[Teor]]'s appointment with Wick, and as she did, her sisters Enmity, [[Cruelty]], and [[Agony (character)|Agony]] all spoke to her in the hall, indicating they knew Wick was ignorant of the true nature of the Creed. She then let Teor in and fetched Wick, who was somewhat nervous. The two saw Teor heal an injured worker. They spoke with him until Yanessa joined them and sent Teor to [[Filoneus]]. Later that night, Tyranny joined Wick as he was brought downstairs to learn the truth about the Halovar's power and was shown [[Aetheon]], the [[celestial]] they had imprisoned who was the true source of [[Filament]].{{ep ref|ep=4x02}} Following this revelation Tyranny suggested she draw Wick a bath, and Yanessa agreed that would be thoughtful. Once there, she told Wick that she hadn't wanted to lie to him, but had to, and that his family had a deal with hers, but her contract was to him and he could dismiss her if he wanted. She also told him she suspected Teor had been sent to his death, and encouraged him to help her rescue him. Wick agreed, and the two went to the [[Mercanaud Couturier]], where Tyranny was able to convince [[Rulius and Calastro Mercanaud]] to release Teor to them. They all went to [[Hal]]'s house, where Teor learned his brother [[Cyd]] had fled chasing [[Casimir]], who had betrayed the plan to save Thjazi. Teor told Tyranny and Wick he owed them for saving his life, and they, along with Thimble and Kattigan, all realized they should flee the city and follow Casimir's trail.{{ep ref|ep=4x03}}

'''Halandil''' "'''Hal'''" '''Fang''' is an [[orc]] [[bard]], the brother of [[Thjazi Fang]], and the owner of the [[Hallowed Round]]. As a player character in [[Campaign 4]], he is played by [[Liam O'Brien]].

== Description ==
[[File:Halandil Fang - Solelle.jpg|300px|thumb|left|{{caption|subject=Halandil Fang|artist=Solelle|artist2=Hannah Friederichs|source=https://x.com/CriticalRole/status/1967679670117355613}}]]

=== Personality ===
&lt;!-- Insert character personality here. If there is not a lot of information to dedicate sections for them, consider deleting the header and merging the section upwards.--&gt;

{{clr|left}}
== Biography ==
=== Before Campaign 4 ===
Halandil fought in part of the [[War of Axe and Vine]].{{ep ref|ep=4x1|1:05:17}} He and Thaisha were romantically involved and had [[Alogar]] and [[Shadia]], their children, together, when they were younger, and after Thaisha left to adventure, he raised the children. He and Thaisha are still close.{{ep ref|ep=4x01|40:40}} After Thjazi was captured, Hal had tried to stay the execution peacefully through political channels with [[Wicander Halovar]].{{ep ref|ep=4x01|1:49:40}} He also, earlier the day of Thjazi's execution, received the deed to the [[Dithyramb of Azgra]], an amphitheater he had long wanted.{{ep ref|ep=4x01|1:48:09}}

=== [[Campaign 4]] ===
[[Azune]] helped Hal be able to speak with Thjazi shortly before his execution, and when Thjazi realized he was indeed about to die he frantically told him to help [[Murray]], that [[Bolaire]] has paint, and to tell [[Thimble]] not to be afraid. Hal then hosted the wake for Thjazi, sharing moments with his family and friends. When Wick arrived, the two went upstairs and Hal asked him what had happened, regarding [[House Halovar]]'s choice to go through with the execution. Wick told him he did not know, but gave Hal Thjazi's sword.{{ep ref|ep=4x01}} After [[Vaelus]] arrived, Thaisha opened the box she had brought for Thjazi from [[Venatus]], and fell unconscious, at which Hal healed her. Later, after most of the guests left, he and his daughter Hero, from his other partner [[Elodie]], played "Broken Wing", an anthem of the [[Falconer's Rebellion]] for the remaining guests. He asked Vaelus to leave as everyone went to bed, as they did not have the [[Stone of Nightsong]] she was searching for, and she did; Thaisha, [[Occtis Tachonis|Occtis]], and Thimble slept at the house. The following morning, he told Thimble she was always welcome at his home, and made breakfast with Thaisha.{{ep ref|ep=4x02}}

Later that day, Hal visited the theater, renamed the [[Hallowed Round]], with Thaisha and various members of his troupe. Bolaire came by with the paints, and Hal asked about them as he had only heard of them shortly before Thjazi died. He later returned home to find Thimble and [[Kattigan]], who had discovered that [[Casimir Gavendale]] had betrayed Thjazi and likely been the person who attacked Thimble. Hal, realizing [[Teor]] had not returned, sent out messengers, but Teor soon after arrived with Wick and [[Tyranny]], having been rescued by them from the [[Mercanaud Couturier]]. After some discussion, Kattigan, Thimble, Teor, Tyranny, and Wick realized they needed to leave the city for their own safety and could use the opportunity to track Casimir. As they left, Hal pulled aside Thimble and told her to find Casimir, Inspiring her.{{ep ref|ep=4x03}}

== Biography ==
Murray works at the [[Penteveral]].{{ep ref|ep=4x1|3:49:00}} She was taken in there having been a "squatter".{{ep ref|ep=4x02|3:41:02}}

=== [[Campaign 4]] ===
Murray arrived at the funeral late, and networked with a number of the other arcanists there as well as made small talk with [[Bolaire]].{{ep ref|ep=4x01}} After [[Thaisha]] touched the coffin of [[Olbalad]], Murray used her ''Mage Hand'' to close it without touching it and helped Bolaire bring it to the [[Archanade]], where the two investigated it until morning. They found it was much deeper than it looked. Murray then left to go to the Penteveral, where she was stopped by a student who told her [[Ellipides Tallbarrel]] had been forced to resign. Upset, she went to his office, and learned that he had chosen to do so to prevent the [[Sundered Houses]] from prohibiting students from practicing arcane magic. They were interrupted by the arrival of [[Primus Tachonis]], who was looking for his son [[Occtis]].{{ep ref|ep=4x02}} During the conversation with Primus, Murray repeatedly angered him by refusing to be intimidated, to the point that he attempted to curse her and threatened to kill her. Ellipides interceded and Murray left to find [[Azune]]. The two met in Caravan Hill and discussed the Sundered Houses recent political takeovers of their respective workplaces, and decided to go to [[Hal]]'s. On the way, they learned of the fight with the [[Crow Keepers]]. At the house, they learned of [[Casimir Gavendale]]'s betrayal as well. She flirted with [[Kattigan]], and demanded an apology for [[Wick]] on behalf of his family, which he gave and she accepted.{{ep ref|ep=4x03}}

'''Wicander "Wick" Halovar''' is an [[aasimar]] sorcerer of the [[Candescent Creed]]. As a player character in [[Campaign 4]], he is played by [[Sam Riegel]].

== Description ==
[[File:Wicander Halovar - Solelle.jpg|300px|thumb|left|{{caption|subject=Wicander Halovar|artist=Solelle|artist2=Hannah Friederichs|source=https://x.com/CriticalRole/status/1967679675028869126}}]]
Wicander is a tall{{ep ref|ep=4x01|1:19:28|more=Sam describes Wicander as "a tall man, 5'11"}} and beautiful human man, with light teal and white hair. He has pearlescent face markings over half of his face, that seem to shimmer with a light of their own. He wears light teal robes. He carries a cane with the symbol of the Candescent Creed.

=== Personality ===
Wicander is greatly preoccupied with his role as a scion of [[House Halovar]] and a Light Priest of the Candescent Creed. He often quotes the texts of the Creed, and attempts to follow its tenets in his daily life.{{ep ref|ep=4x01|1:46:52}}

== Biography ==
=== Before Campaign 4 ===
At some point, Wick fell in love with a commoner but was not permitted to marry her.{{ep ref|ep=4x03|0:49:07}}

In the few weeks leading up to [[Thjazi Fang]]'s execution, [[Halandil Fang]] worked with Wick to attempt to have his family stay the execution.{{ep ref|ep=4x01|1:53:21}}

=== [[Campaign 4]] ===
At the execution, Wick was told by [[Yanessa Halovar|his grandmother]] moments before it occurred that House Halovar would be calling for it along with [[House Tachonis]], which was a shock to him. Later, he and [[Tyranny]] arrived at Thjazi's wake at Hal's home, Wick bringing Thjazi's sword to give to Hal. After Tyranny gave him a drink, Wick was called to Hal's study. Hal asked him what had happened, and Wick told him he'd tried, but Hal was hesitant to trust him. He then rejoined the wake, and [[Loza Blade]] recognized the sword. When she did, Wick gave it to Hal. She also set up a meeting between Wick and her companion [[Teor Pridesire]] for an interview as a guard. Lady [[Aranessa]] arrived soon after and was, unbeknownst to him, extremely angry with Wick and the Candescent Creed. After she began to ask Wick why she'd been denied an audience with his house, Tyranny pretended to vomit and the two left quickly.{{ep ref|ep=4x01}}

The following day, Wick met with Teor and was interrupted by Yanessa, who sent Teor to be outfitted and told Wick to get rid of him. When Wick seemed confused as to why, she grew openly frustrated with him and told him to be less naive, that their house was once priests in [[Obridimia]], and that they needed to maintain good terms with House Tachonis for the sake of their own power. She told him she would reveal more that night. Wick's father, Lord [[Godard]], called on him that night and brought him and Tyranny deep below the [[Villa Aurora]] into a basement, and along with Yanessa, revealed that they had a massive [[celestial]] named [[Aetheon]] kept captive, and that [[Filament]] was the product of Aetheon, his grandfather.{{ep ref|ep=4x02}} Yanessa then explained further that she had used Filament to cast a spell and had given birth to Godard as a result. She also explained the truth: following the death of the [[Shapers]], she had developed the Candescent Creed as people still needed religion, and as a source of wealth and power for the family. Wick's mother [[Iris Halovar|Iris]] loved the Creed and requested Wick be raised as a true believer and as the face of the family so he could make an advantageous political marriage; everyone else, including his sister [[Zebani Halovar|Zebani]] and the [[demon]]s were aware the Creed had been created by Yanessa and Filament came from Aetheon. Wick was taken aback but said he would continue as the scion of the house, and Tyranny suggested he take a bath. Upstairs in his chambers, Tyranny explained that not only was everything Yanessa had said true, but that the Halovars had a deal with her family for power, that they were afraid of his willpower and moral certainty and that was why they'd told him the truth, and that Teor was likely on his way to be killed. The two of them decided to leave together to rescue Teor. They did so, though Tyranny did most of the talking at the [[Mercanaud Couturier]], and then headed to Hal's house. There, they learned that Teor's brother had left the city yesterday in pursuit of [[Casimir Gavendale]], who had sold out Thjazi, and, upon realizing they were themselves about to be wanted by House Halovar, fled the city with [[Thimble]] and [[Kattigan]] to track Casimir to [[Gormalay]].{{ep ref|ep=4x03}}

{{clr|left}}
== Biography ==
=== Before Campaign 4 ===
Occtis failed to demonstrate sorcerous abilities as were typical of [[House Tachonis]] and was sent by his family to the [[Penteveral]]'s boarding school to learn magic.{{ep ref|ep=4x03|52:48}}

[[Thjazi Fang]] helped Occtis when he was a child,{{ep ref|ep=4x01|44:08}} and six months prior to Thjazi's execution, Occtis and [[Thaisha]] went to [[Venatus]] to retrieve an item for him.{{ep ref|ep=4x02|21:30}} Occtis and Thaisha were also supposed to help Thjazi get away after he escaped his execution.{{ep ref|ep=4x01|2:36:16}}

=== [[Campaign 4]] ===
Occtis and Thaisha arrived at the wake together, and Occtis addressed Thjazi's body. When [[Azune]] arrived, he and Occtis decided to go find [[Thimble]], and took [[Teor]] with them as well. They found Thjazi's hideout had been ransacked and Thimble attacked. [[Kattigan]] followed them to the location and was able to determine the assailants were likely [[Crow Keepers]].{{ep ref|ep=4x01}} The group, including Kattigan and Thimble, returned to [[Hal]]'s home, and explained what had happened regarding the plan. Occtis comforted Thimble, and helped Azune determine why the rune on Thjazi had appeared legitimate. He had [[Pincushion]] watch [[Vaelus]] and Thimble's interaction, but both realized he was spying on them. He then stayed overnight in Thaisha's room. Upon waking up, he agreed to join Thimble and Kattigan in tracking down the Crow Keepers and [[Casimir Gavendale]]. Upon arriving at the [[Guard Tower]], after Thimble asked [[Solomon]] about Casimir, the rogues attacked.{{ep ref|ep=4x02}} The fight initially went poorly until [[Vaelus]], who had followed them, arrived and killed two Crow Keepers. The group interrogated another and learned that Casimir had sold them out. They returned to Hal's house, where [[Julien]] was waiting, having been told by [[Raimond Davinos|his father]] and Lady [[Aranessa]] to find Occtis and bring him to them. Meanwhile, [[Primus Tachonis]] was asking for Occtis at the [[Penteveral]]. Occtis agreed to join Julien, and Vaelus came along to the [[Palazzo Davinos]], where Aranessa brought Occtis to a room where he could stay. She asked about the plan to save Thjazi as well as the coffin he had retrieved and the [[Stone of Nightsong]]. Occtis was somewhat evasive, but they were interrupted when his brother [[Ethrand Tachonis]] entered the room, along with six [[ghoul]]s and the Stone of Nightsong and commanded them to implant the stone in Occtis.{{ep ref|ep=4x03}}

== Biography ==
=== Before Campaign 4 ===
Teor served in the [[Torn Banner]] during the [[Falconer's Rebellion]].{{ep ref|ep=4x02|5:47}} He remained with his commander [[Loza Blade]] as a mercenary afterwards, and they returned to [[Dol-Makjar]] shortly prior to [[Thjazi]]'s execution.{{ep ref|ep=4x01|1:05:54}}

=== [[Campaign 4]] ===
Teor and Loza came to Thjazi's funeral together. There, Teor reunited with [[Azune]], who had also served with them, and told Azune he had hoped to settle back in town because his brother [[Cyd]] still lived here. He and Azune, along with [[Occtis]], left the funeral after a few hours to investigate Thjazi's safe house. There, they found it ransacked, and [[Thimble]] unconscious. Teor healed her, and the group broke the news of Thjazi's death to her. [[Kattigan]], who had also served in the Torn Banner, joined, having followed the others, and was able to determine a likely lead on who had attacked Thimble.{{ep ref|ep=4x01}} They returned to the wake and updated others involved in the plan to save Thjazi with what had happened. Teor learned that Cyd had been part of the plan from Azune and Occtis, and told them that Cyd was generally not very trustworthy and had a history of stealing. Upon leaving the wake with Loza, she told him that she would be retiring and heading further west, but gave him a case containing half of a banner that had once been the pennant of the now disbanded Torn Banner. She also told him she had set up a meeting with [[Wicander Halovar]] for a security job for him. The following day, he went to the meeting, and while waiting for Wick healed a worker who was injured when a crate fell. Wick seemed amenable to hiring him, as did [[Tyranny]], but [[Yanessa Halovar]] felt he was asking too many questions and sent him to [[Filoneus Halovar]]{{ep ref|ep=4x02}} to pass on to the [[Mercanaud Couturier]], the house's fixers. On the way, Teor encountered [[Julien]], who realized that Teor was likely being sent to his death, but did not intervene. At the Couterier, once [[Rulius and Calastro Mercanaud]] realized Teor had been sent to be "outfitted", they captured him and began cutting up his shadow. However, Tyranny and Wick, having decided to save Teor after Wick had learned the truth about the [[Candescent Creed]], convinced the Mercanaud twins to let Teor go. They all went to [[Hal]]'s home, where they met Thimble and Kattigan, who told them [[Casimir Gavendale]], another former member of the Torn Banner, was the traitor, and Cyd had run after him in pursuit towards [[Gormalay]]. They all realized they needed to leave the city as they were in danger from [[House Halovar]] or the [[Crow Keepers]] and with Azune's help left that night.{{ep ref|ep=4x03}}

'''Thjazi Fang''' is an [[orc]] in [[Aramán]]. Described as a "hero to many [and] enemy to some", his sudden and impending execution is the precipitating event of [[Campaign 4]]. As a [[non-player character]], he is played by [[Brennan Lee Mulligan]].

== Description ==
Thjazi is an [[orc]] with dark, graying hair.{{ep ref|intro=Thumbnail for|vod=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgK_qRwpygA|ep=Critical Role IV {{!}} Official Trailer}}

=== Personality ===

== Biography ==
=== Before Campaign 4 ===
Thjazi grew up with his mother and his and [[Halandil Fang]]'s father on the edge of the Rookery in [[Dol-Makjar]].{{ep ref|ep=4x1|3:56:07}}

He fought in the [[War of Axe and Vine]]. He married [[Aranessa Royce]], a noblewoman of the [[Sundered Houses]]. As a wedding present, he was gifted the [[fairy]] [[Thimble]], and the two became best friends.{{ep ref|ep=4x02|1:01:56}} Two years later, he participated in the [[Falconer's Rebellion]], and Aranessa's grandfather sided against Thjazi.{{ep ref|ep=4x1|3:23:25}} Thjazi is described as having lived a "remarkable life" and became a "hero to many [and] enemy to some". He felt that he "didn't get in nearly as much trouble as I wanted to".&lt;ref name="Trailer"/&gt;

At the end of the [[Falconer's Rebellion]],{{ep ref|ep=4x02|3:07:36}} he was knocked off his horse and brought to the authorities by [[Julien Davinos]]. He was granted clemency.{{ep ref|ep=4x1|3:24:27}}

Several years prior to his death, Thjazi learned the truth about [[Bolaire]]'s nature, and used this to blackmail Bolaire into providing him with artifacts from the museum. He also forbid Bolaire from telling this to Hal, whom Bolaire had befriended. Thimble served as go-between in this arrangement.{{ep ref|ep=4x04|3:52:44}} In the months leading up to his death, Thjazi had also sent [[Thaisha]] and [[Occtis]] to retrieve an item from [[Venatus]], which turned out to be a coffin of [[Olbalad]], the psychopomp [[celestial]] of [[Rauwyn]];{{ep ref|ep=4x02|21:30}} and had himself stolen the [[Stone of Nightsong]] from the [[Sisters of Sylandri]].{{ep ref|ep=4x02|1:26:35}}

[[File:Thjazi Fang - Hannah Friederichs.png|thumb|left|200px|{{caption|nointro=true|subject=Thjazi Fang|artist=Hannah Friederichs|source=https://critrole.com/campaign4/}}]]
Thjazi was suddenly jailed and sentenced to death in the city of [[Dol-Makjar]], drawing people from throughout his life together to find the truth behind his impending execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{CR|what-is-campaign-4|What Is Campaign Four?}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his execution approached, he described himself as "beset by enemies on all sides".{{ep ref|vod=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgK_qRwpygA|ep=Critical Role IV {{!}} Official Trailer|name="Trailer"}} Despite efforts from his brother Hal to make a deal with [[House Halovar]] to stay his execution,{{ep ref|ep=4x01|1:50:49}} and a plan in which Thimble would create a rune to transport Thjazi away from the gallows, which [[Azune]] would not report when doing his scan as an [[Arcane Marshal]], after which [[Cyd Pridesire]] would serve as the driver of a getaway car that Occtis and Thaisha would meet,{{ep ref|ep=4x01|2:36:16}} both plans failed and Thjazi was executed.{{ep ref|ep=4x01|18:34}} Prior to his death, with the help of Azune's ''Message'' spell, he was able to speak with Hal. He grew panicky upon seeing something in the sky and told Hal that [[Bolaire]] had paints, to help [[Murray]], and to tell [[Thimble]] not to be afraid.{{ep ref|ep=4x01|16:29}}

== Description ==
Yanessa is an elderly woman dressed in white.{{Ep ref|ep=4x1|13:25}}

=== Personality ===
She projects a young and self-assured image to the public, but is much more vulgar and casual with her family, cursing her old age and occasionally the attitude of the demons in addition to calling [[Wicander Halovar]] "little Wicky" and [[Tyranny]] "lovey".{{Ep ref|ep=4x1|1:30:54}}

== Biography ==
===Before Campaign 4===
Yanessa was born to House Halovar prior to the events of the [[Shapers' War]]. Her family served as priests to [[Tansul]], the god of the sun, and were considered to be the right hand of the Obridimian royal house. As a young girl, she lived through the fall of the gods and the heart of the Obridimian Empire being cast into eternal darkness. The Halovars survived being deposed by becoming a merchant company in order to restore their family's name and status. At some point afterwards, Yanessa came across the [[celestial]], [[Aetheon]], and secured it beneath [[Villa Aurora]]. She took Aetheon's blood and used it to power a ''Wish'' spell in order to conceive a [[Godard Halovar|child]].{{Ep ref|ep=4x03|23:57|29:44}} Her descendants wield divine power in various forms.{{Ep ref|ep=4x2|4:29:07}}

Three years before the events of {{ep|4x01}}, Yanessa founded the [[Candescent Creed]].

===[[Campaign 4]]===
Yanessa announces the execution of [[Thjazi Fang]] ordered by the [[Lords Advisory]]. Her and her son dismiss her [[Wicander Halovar|grandson]]'s pleas to commute Thjazi's sentence.{{Ep ref|ep=4x1|1:32:05}}

We'll talk more later.{{ep ref|1:32:05|ep=4x01}}
* '''Wick''': I'm sorry, the Filament is that creature's blood?&lt;br/&gt;'''Yanessa''': No, no, no, Wicky.&lt;br/&gt;'''Wick''': Oh.&lt;br/&gt;'''Yanessa''': It ain't got blood. It is Light, you know, but it's in his body, yeah, but it's also his spit. You know, it's hard to say. It is Light. It's just, it's just what he's made of, innit?&lt;br/&gt;'''Wick''': It's not the distilled liquid of the universe?&lt;br/&gt;'''Yanessa''': ''(sighs)''&lt;br/&gt;'''Wick''': We've been drinking this from the Radiant Chalice. We've been tattooing it on my body.&lt;br/&gt;'''Yanessa''': Many people's bodies, yeah. A lot of bodies.{{ep ref|23:11|ep=4x03}}
* '''Yanessa''': If you can't be an empire, you take your licks, you pick yourself up, and you start a church or a merchant company.{{ep ref|30:14|ep=4x03}}
* '''Yanessa''': The things that we say in the Creed, it's good rules. You write down these rules because you know that people you don't know are going to read them, and you want there to be something that makes the ground under your feet steady. You need some reliability, right? It's sort of like:&lt;br/&gt;There's a lake with fish in it, and it's good fish, but it's not yours, it's the king's, and you want to poach those fish, yeah? But if everybody does it, it'd be all out of fish because that's why the rule's there, so the ideal situation is only you poach the fish so you get your fish, but nobody else does because they believe in the rule that you shouldn't do that.{{ep ref|33:23|ep=4x03}}
* '''[[Tyranny]]''': I was wondering if I might go draw &amp;lsqb;Wick&amp;rsqb; a hot bath so he can decompress and think about his next steps.&lt;br/&gt;'''Yanessa''': What a thoughtful demon you are. That sounds lovely. Now, not as hot as you'd like it, otherwise my little grandson will get burned.&lt;br/&gt;'''Tyranny''': Don't want to cook him.&lt;br/&gt;'''Yanessa''': Ah, a boiled grandson!&lt;br/&gt;'''Tyranny''': ''(laughs)''&lt;br/&gt;'''Wick''': Oh, that would not be good.{{ep ref|37:27|ep=4x03}}

'''Pincushion''', or '''Pin''', is the fox familiar of [[Occtis Tachonis]].{{ep ref|ep=4x01|2:43:19}} As Occtis's familiar, Pincushion is played by [[Alexander Ward]] and [[Brennan Lee Mulligan]].

== Description ==
Pin is a small, mostly white fox made of pieces of different foxes, with purple button eyes. Its front right leg and one of its ears is from a red fox, while most of the rest of Pin's body is an arctic fox.{{ep ref|ep=4x02|1:35:08}}

He wears a purple scarf around his neck.{{ep ref|ep=4x02|1:35:23}}

=== Personality ===
&lt;!-- Insert character personality here. If there is not a lot of information to dedicate sections for them, consider deleting the header and merging the section upwards.--&gt;

Pin is playful with other animals he's familiar with, notably [[Wulferic]].{{ep ref|ep=4x01|2:43:28}}

== Biography ==
&lt;!--If character relationships can fit within the biography and background, please put them here. If they are too long to fit in the biography you can create a separate section for relationships above "Character information"--&gt;
=== Before Campaign 4 ===
Pincushion was created by Occtis, who was aiming to create something more fearsome.{{ep ref|ep=4x03|3:37:40}} However, Pin was "terrible at it" so Occtis made him a familiar instead.{{ep ref|ep=4x03|3:41:39}}

=== [[Campaign 4]] ===
&lt;!-- Insert relevant events here. You may also choose to use a section titled something like "Campaign 2: Weird Magic Arc" instead if it is easier to write about this character in paragraph form, particularly if they appear in many episodes.--&gt;

== Character information ==
&lt;!--=== Notable items ===
--&gt;
=== Abilities ===
&lt;!-- Reminder: classes are not proper nouns. They should be lowercase. --&gt;
As a familiar, Pincushion can appear and disappear at Occtis's command, though he sometimes appears without being summoned.{{ep ref|ep=4x03|3:37:40}} Occtis can see and hear through Pin's eyes and ears, communicate with him telepathically, and cast spells through him. If Pin drops to 0 HP or if Occtis wishes to change Pin's form, Occtis can cast ''Find Familiar'' again to resummon him in the desired form.{{Print ref|phb2024|272}}

=== Personality ===
Hal's children see Olgud as an uncle,{{ep ref|ep=4x01|36:11}} and at the funeral he is treated as a member of the family; he offers to help receive guests to take some of the burden off Hal.{{ep ref|ep=4x01|36:20}} He is friendly and helpful with [[Tyranny]].{{ep ref|ep=4x01|1:39:35|name="Tyranny"}}

'''Primus Tachonis''' is the father of [[Occtis Tachonis]] and head of [[House Tachonis]]. As a [[non-player character]] in [[Campaign 4]], he is played by [[Brennan Lee Mulligan]].

== Description ==
Primus is described as tall and graven, with sallow skin. Shadows lengthen around him, a sign of his sorcerous magic.{{ep ref|ep=4x02}}

== Biography ==
=== [[Campaign 4]] ===
The day after [[Thjazi Fang]]'s execution, Primus arrived at the [[Penteveral]], interrupting a conversation between [[Ellipides Tallbarrel]] and [[Murray Mag'Nesson]] to tell them that he was looking for his son [[Occtis]].{{ep ref|ep=4x02}} During the conversation with Primus, Murray repeatedly angered him by refusing to be intimidated, to the point that he attempted to curse her and threatened to kill her. Ellipides interceded and Murray left to find [[Azune Nayar]]. Primus told Tallbarrel that he wants her to be fired.{{ep ref|ep=4x03}}

Later that night, Primus and his son [[Ethrand Tachonis|Ethrand]] assaulted [[Palazzo Davinos]], having tracked Occtis there. Primus cast a spell to allow [[shade]]s to cross over from the [[Tenebral Reaches]], and under the cover of his Umbral Form, Primus killed General [[Raimond Davinos]]. Sir [[Julien]] fought back against his father's killer as Primus cast ''Circle of Death'', slaughtering the courtiers inside. He announced his intent to destroy the houses of [[House Royce|Royce]] and [[House Davinos|Davinos]] as Ethrand killed Occtis and implanted the [[Stone of Nightsong]] into his body. Primus then absconded with Ethrand via ''Plane Shift''.{{ep ref|ep=4x04}} &lt;!--Add whatever happened with Occtis's soul that Primus seemingly bore witness to.--&gt;

== Biography ==
=== Before Campaign 4 ===
Lady Zebani Halovar is the daughter of [[Iris Halovar]] and [[Godard Halovar]], who is the son of [[Yanessa Halovar]] that she created through a spell using the "blood" (referred to as [[Filament]]) of the [[celestial]] [[Aetheon]]. To increase [[House Halovar]]'s power, Yanessa devised the [[Candescent Creed]] the obfuscated the origins of Filament. Yanessa needed someone to manage the lower levels of the [[Villa Aurora]], where Aetheon is kept and Filament is drawn out of him, so she informed Zebani of the truth some time before Campaign 4 and tasked with the job.{{ep ref|ep=4x03|0:31:04|name="Basement"}}

=== [[Campaign 4]] ===
Zebani is present when the truth of [[Filament]] and the [[Candescent Creed]] is revealed to Wicander. He is unaware of her presence until after the [[Prismatic Retort]] is opened and he meets Aetheon. She is accompanied by [[Cruelty]]. She grimly tells Wicander that she is glad he knows the truth now like the rest of the family. She stares ahead throughout the following conversation between Yanessa and Wicander about the Creed and Halovar family history. When Wicander asks if he is still the family's scion, Zebani agrees that it is a good question, but Yanessa sharply chides her to not speak. Yanessa describes Zebani as skilled but "not set up to be the face of much of anything"; Wicander defends her as "lovely", but Tyranny scoffs incredulously.&lt;ref name="Basement"/&gt;

== Appearances and mentions ==

** {{appearance|4x03|appear}}

== Trivia ==
* ''Zebani'' in Turkish means demon of hell, fiend, hellhound, or a cruel monster&lt;ref&gt;"[https://tureng.com/en/turkish-english/zebani zebani]" at Tureng, a Turkish-English dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; and also refers to the [[WP:Zabaniyah|Zabaniyah]], fallen angels in Islam who torture the wicked in Hell.

Raimond has a silver mustache and goatee. His face is scarred. He wears a golden breastplate and helm. Similar to all of the soldiers of House Davinos, he also wears a gauntlet on his hand.{{ep ref|ep=4x02|2:58:14}}

== Biography ==
=== Before Campaign 4 ===
Raimond fought in the [[War of Axe and Vine]]. Near the end of the war, [[Thjazi Fang]] saved the life of Raimond's nephew, an act that ingratiated Thjazi to Raimond and his house. Because of this friendship, Raimond went against House Royce during the [[Falconer's Rebellion]]. His son Julien rode off against Raimond's orders in order to capture Thjazi and restore their house's status, ending the rebellion.{{ep ref|ep=4x02|3:05:55|3:09:00}}

=== [[Campaign 4]] ===
Raimond arrives at the Tangled Sheet in search of his son, Julien. He scolds Julien for having run off the night after the execution of Lady [[Aranessa Royce|Aranessa's]] estranged husband and demands he get in the carriage. They ride to Palazzo Davinos where Lady Aranessa is waiting for them. There, Raimond informs Julien that [[Occtis Tachonis]] was part of a plot to rescue Thjazi and that [[House Tachonis|his family]] is looking for him. Raimond tasks Julien with intercepting Occtis before the Tachonis find him and bringing him back to the Palazzo so Lady Aranessa may speak with him.{{ep ref|ep=4x02|3:11:03}}

When Julien returns with Occtis, Raimond is there with Aranessa to receive him. He pulls Julien aside and asks if Julien has heard anything about "[[Stone of Nightsong|a stone]]," to which Julien declines and leaves to find Vaelus. A short time later, Raimond follows his son into the gardens, calling out that there was something he wanted to tell Julien, but before he can finish his sentence, Raimond is killed by [[Primus Tachonis]],{{ep ref|ep=4x04|0:31:06}} who spectrally pulled his skull and spine out of his body.{{ep ref|ep=4x03|4:32:42|4:57:28}}

'''Solomon''' is a guildmaster of the [[Crow Keepers]].{{ep ref|ep=4x03|1:05:19}} Though he is referred to as Solomon among the Crow Keepers, it may not be his real name.{{ep ref|ep=4x02|4:14:04}} As a [[non-player character]] in [[Campaign 4]], Solomon is played by [[Brennan Lee Mulligan]].

== Description ==

=== [[Campaign 4]] ===
Solomon was at the bar in [[The Guard Tower]] when [[Thimble]], [[Occtis Tachonis|Occtis]] and [[Kattigan Vale|Kattigan]] entered searching for [[Casimir Gavendale]]. Thimble asked Solomon about Casimir, but he did not respond and a fight broke out.{{ep ref|ep=4x02|4:14:45}} When Thimble threatened one of the Crow Keepers and demanded Solomon call off his henchmen, he did not take her seriously. Occtis cast ''Cause Fear'', but Solomon resisted the spell and remained unintimidated, saying, "Oh, throwing a little bit of magic around? I don't need anything other than a knife to make you scared, my friend."{{ep ref|ep=4x03|1:12:20}}

Once the Crow Keepers had successfully restrained [[Wulferic]] and trapped Thimble in a bag, Solomon offered condolences to Thimble on the death of [[Thjazi Fang]], but threatened to kill both Occtis and Kattigan, as he did not know them.{{ep ref|ep=4x03|1:20:09}} At that point, [[Vaelus]] crashed through the window and immediately killed the Crow Keeper holding Thimble. She then placed her ''Hunter's Mark'' on Solomon, her eyes going black, leaving him "genuinely frightened."{{ep ref|ep=4x03|1:26:31}} Occtis singed Solomon with magical fire, before Vaelus cast ''Guiding Bolt'' on Solomon, killing him.{{ep ref|ep=4x03|1:38:16}}

Ethrand joined his father [[Primus Tachonis]] in the attack on [[Palazzo Davinos]].

While under a field of ''Silence'', the ghouls restrained Occtis on a table and Ethrand stabbed him in the chest. Dropping the ''Silence'', Ethrand told his brother that there was always something wrong with him and he should've simply accepted the family name. He then carved out Occtis' heart and plunged the [[Stone of Nightsong]] into his brother's chest. Etherand then ordered the ghouls to throw Aranessa over the balcony. As Ethrand retreated he was confronted by [[Thaisha Lloy]], but escaped as Primus appeared and rescued him by ''Plane Shifting'' away.{{ep ref|ep=4x04|01:44:32}}

Ulbid had a wife, Jasavi, who died some time prior to [[Thjazi]]'s execution.{{ep ref|ep=4x05|3:11:06}} He also has three daughters, Cerebel, Demuriel, and Elanadel, who left to join the [[Falconer's Rebellion]] and did not return.{{ep ref|ep=4x05|3:32:25}}

=== [[Campaign 4]] ===
After the [[Soldiers' table]] freed Abalang, he told them that if they went through the Dahapshanee Wood, they could seek out Ulbid, who lived in a watchtower within it.{{ep ref|ep=4x05|2:28:02}} Upon arriving, they noticed a sign in gnomish, which they could not read, and some waterlogged fireworks. They also noticed traps against [[undead]] and [[demon]]s, the latter of which [[Tyranny]] triggered.{{ep ref|ep=4x05|2:59:23}} Ulbid welcomed them in upon learning they were friends of Abalang.&lt;ref name="Abalang"/&gt; He told them a little about his work, including that the Stormwrack appears to be worsening{{ep ref|ep=4x05|3:09:56}} and that he'd seen king's banners on the southward road.{{ep ref|ep=4x05|3:16:10}} [[Thimble]] found a toy chest in his house, as well as some toy soldiers, and asked him if he could make her [[Thimble's toy sword|a slashing weapon]], to which he agreed.{{ep ref|ep=4x05|3:19:29}}

While on watch that night, [[Teor]] asked Ulbid about the gnomish banner, and learned that it reads "Welcome Home" for his daughters, who joined the Falconer's Rebellion and never returned. Ulbid told him that he did not know what had happened to them, but could not stand the idea of leaving to search for them and no one being home to greet them. Teor told him that he too was a veteran of the rebellion and would tell his daughters to return should he ever encounter them.{{ep ref|ep=4x05|3:34:27}}

'''Abalang Howl''' is a mixed [[orc]]ish and [[dwarvish]] thief. As a [[non-player character]] in [[Campaign 4]], Abalang is played by [[Brennan Lee Mulligan]].

== Description ==
Abalang appears orcish but is very short and stocky, and has a braided beard.{{ep ref|ep=4x05|2:11:46|name="Intro"}} He is of both orcish and dwarvish heritage.{{ep ref|ep=4x06|0:18:45}}

=== Personality ===
Abalang is a "fast talker" and considered charming enough to survive in a gibbet by talking people into giving him food.{{ep ref|ep=4x05|3:06:16}} He is forthright with [[Thimble]] and offers his condolences regarding [[Thjazi]]'s death.{{ep ref|ep=4x05|2:19:01}}

== Biography ==
=== Before Campaign 4 ===
Thimble and Thjazi had encountered Abalang in [[Dol-Makjar]] a few times prior to Thjazi's execution.{{ep ref|ep=4x05|2:14:25}}

=== [[Campaign 4]] ===
The [[Soldier's table]] encountered Abalang early in the morning, in a gibbet outside of the Black Heron inn at a crossroads on the way north from Dol-Makjar. He asked them if they could spare some food, which they did, and when Thimble flew up to give it to him, he recognized her and she him.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; He revealed that he had been imprisoned and left to starve or die after stealing from a [[Candescent Creed]] wagon.{{ep ref|ep=4x05|2:14:51}} [[Wick]], unaccustomed to and opposed to lying, told him that he was a member of [[House Halovar]].{{ep ref|ep=4x05|2:16:25}} Thimble meanwhile offered to free Abalang, and was able to do so.{{ep ref|ep=4x05|2:19:47}} She also asked him if he had seen any [[nama]] on the road from his vantage point, to which he said he had not, but did see a caravan with both [[Crow Keepers]] and [[House Tachonis]] guards.{{ep ref|ep=4x05|2:23:29}} [[Teor]] healed Abalang, whose legs had gone numb in the gibbet, and [[Tyranny]] convinced him to not reveal who had freed him, but to say that "Nick" had imprisoned him. As the party was leaving their horses to go into the [[Dahapshanee Wood]], they also permitted Abalang to take one.{{ep ref|ep=4x05|2:24:29}} In thanks, he told them that regardless of the direction they chose, they could use his name to get shelter either at an inn up the road, or at the home of [[Ulbid Morn]], and that he would leave without seeing which direction they chose so that he could honestly say he did not know where they went.{{ep ref|ep=4x05|2:27:24}}

'''Aubrus Drime''' is a [[WP:fence (criminal)|fence]] in [[Dol-Makjar]]. He meets with [[Bolaire Lathalia]], a [[panto mask]], and becomes the person wearing Bolaire. As an NPC in [[Campaign 4]] of ''[[Critical Role]]'', Aubrus is played by [[Brennan Lee Mulligan]].

== Description ==
Aubrus is described as an able-bodied man who is "not too terrifically tall" and was of similar proportions to the person Bolaire was previously attached to. He has a shaved head and a nick in one ear.{{ep ref|ep=4x04|0h10m16s|0h17m25s|name="ColdOpen"}}

== Biography ==
Abrus worked as a typical [[WP:fence (criminal)|fence]] and worked with the [[Crow Keepers]]. By [[Campaign 4]], he established a reputation and sought to work with "a higher class of smuggled goods". He and [[Bolaire Lathalia]] were in communication for some time before arranging a meeting at [[Speak No Evil]] to exchange money and a treasure. He was surprised that Bolaire would work with criminals.&lt;ref name="ColdOpen"/&gt;

At the meeting, he was eager to receive his promised treasure. Angry that Bolaire had nothing, Abrus cast ''Sleep'' on him and removed the mask. Discovering the body was desiccated and withering, he insulted Bolaire as a freak and noted that killing him was unnecessary as he was essentially dead as is.&lt;ref name="ColdOpen"/&gt; He saw a rune on the inside of the mask, which enchanted and charmed him into putting it on. Bolaire then took Abrus over to replace the previous body.{{ep ref|ep=4x04|4h3m28s}}

When Bolaire explained his nature to [[Azune Nayar]], [[Halandil Fang]], and [[Murray Mag'Nesson]], he offered to show them but stated that Aubrus is ornery.{{ep ref|ep=4x04|4h11m33s}}

'''Hawthorn''' is a [[dryad]] and the leader of [[Hawthorn's Glade]]. As a [[non-player character]] in [[Campaign 4]], she is played by [[Brennan Lee Mulligan]].

== Description ==
Hawthorn moves on a "chariot" of thorns and vines, and has an authoritative voice.{{ep ref|ep=4x06|1:46:30}}

=== Personality ===
Hawthorn is described as someone who is making difficult and risky choices because she has lost too much by playing it safe.{{ep ref|ep=4x06|2:25:49}}

== Biography ==
=== [[Campaign 4]] ===
Hawthorn joined a number of other [[fae]] protectors when [[Wick]], [[Tyranny]], [[Thimble]], [[Teor]], and [[Kattigan]] stumbled across the area near her glade. She asked Thimble if she vouched for her mortal companions, and Thimble did so, but what ultimately convinced Hawthorn was Wick's display of power.{{ep ref|ep=4x06|1:53:55}} When she mentioned that another mortal had recently passed through, and Teor and Wick described [[Cyd]], Hawthorn hesitantly invited them to her glade where her tree was.{{ep ref|ep=4x06|2:24:21}} There, she offered them rest and food, and went to speak with [[Soobri]] and [[Sallow]].{{ep ref|ep=4x06|2:36:37}} In that conversation, Thimble learned that Cyd had passed through, and that he had been sent to the [[Wraith Tree]]. Kattigan, having snuck up, joined the conversation, which angered Hawthorn and led her to tell him and Thimble that they had to leave before nightfall.{{ep ref|ep=4x06|2:53:14}} She also told Thimble that she had become too close to mortals and was forgetting her own nature.{{ep ref|ep=4x06|2:57:55}} Sallow later implied that Hawthorn had made the choice to send mortals to the Wraith Tree.{{ep ref|ep=4x06|3:26:14}}
