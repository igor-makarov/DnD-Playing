## Level 3 Priorities

2. Additional spells: Scorching Ray, Burning Hands (Fiend expanded spells)

## Patron Flavor: Celestial Planetar

Although mechanically a Fiend patron (for blaster-focused expanded spells), Meg's patron is flavored as a **Celestial Planetar**:

- Perhaps a fallen angel seeking redemption
- A celestial on a secret mission requiring morally gray methods
- A being of light corrupted or disguised
- Sacred Flame cantrip reflects this celestial connection

The Hollow One nature could tie into this - perhaps Meg died and was brought back by the Planetar for a purpose.

## Character Concept

Meg is a High Elf who died and returned as a Hollow One, bound to a mysterious Celestial patron (Fiend mechanically). The patron (a Planetar) has granted her eldritch power for an unknown purpose.

She specializes in ranged combat with Eldritch Blast while using defensive magic (Armor of Agathys, Hellish Rebuke) to punish enemies who get too close. The Lucky feat ensures her key attacks land when they matter most.

Her Hollow One nature makes her unsettling to others - she doesn't age, registers as undead, and can unnerve creatures with her mere presence. The Pact of the Tome grants her versatility through additional cantrips and ritual magic.
